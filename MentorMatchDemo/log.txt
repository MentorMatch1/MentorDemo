Fixed the creation of profile by adding a 400 error message to be interpretted by the system and error message be displayed.
In app.py folder created is_valid_email 
added to the api_backend.py by making it so that the tokens are displayed to the model in the format
Email, Description, Name all have capital values in React
User XX:
Name: XXXX
Description: Description Here

Must Do:
Fix login page similar to profileCreation.js and make it link to the dashboard with the users Data being displayed after login

Implemented Logging In from the login page, response from flask back which is then put through localstorage , then users are sent to /dashboard page
their personal data is accessed from localstorages and displayed onto the dashboard (this isnt really secure but thats not really the point of the demo) 

Must do: Dashboard simple styling, Same with styling the login page to not look extremely ugly
